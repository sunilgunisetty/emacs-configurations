* My EMACS configuration
This is my presonal emacs configuration I use for development. I use these setting with terminal emacs on mac OSX. 

* Prerequisites
- Emacs 24+

* Installation
Delete existing emacs configuration by deleting `.emacs.d` from your home directory. (You can also take a backup to revert changes to previous configurations).
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  rm -rf ~/.emacs.d
#+END_SRC
Create `.emacs.d` directory in your home directory
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  mkdir ~/.emacs.d
#+END_SRC
Copy `init.el` and `svg-config.org` to `~/.emacs.d`. 

And start emacs. If emacs prompts you to accept the digital certificate, type `yes` and hit return.
