* My EMACS configuration
This is my presonal emacs configuration I use for development. I use these setting with terminal emacs on mac OSX. 

* Prerequisites
- Emacs 24+

* Installation
Delete existing emacs configuration by deleting .emacs.d from your home. (You can also take a backup to revert changes, if you don't like my configurations).
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  rm -rf ~/.emacs.d
#+END_SRC
Create .emacs.d directory
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  mkdir ~/.emacs.d
#+END_SRC
Copy `init.el` and `svg-config.org` to `~/.emacs.d`.
